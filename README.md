# Convolution Neural Network

## Purpose

In this module a Convolution Neural Network is implemented to classify images. A CNN ML model is trained and tested against a test set to check performance.

## Usage

**Requirements:**

- VM of choice (Anaconda is used)
- IDE of Choice
- Python

To run the jupyter files , `.ipynb`, an IDE like VSCode or Jupyter would work. If you have another IDE that supports the file then use that.

>Downloads: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) | [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

```diff
- Important: Use a VM to run python to avoid bloating computer with python packages. For this repo Anaconda was used. Any other preferred VM can be used.
```

### Steps

- Download VM of choice and create an instance
- Switch to the VM and begin installing packages that which will be in each jupyter file
- Begin running the code - block by block
- Once completed exit the VM and either delete it or keep it for future use
